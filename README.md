# End-to-End Reinforcement Learning for Robust Teleoperation under Stochastic Delays

This repository contains the implementation, simulation environment, and experimental results of the Master's Thesis **"End-to-End Reinforcement Learning for Robust Teleoperation under Stochastic Delays"** conducted at the **Technical University of Munich (TUM)**.

## Project Overview

Stochastic communication delays in teleoperation introduce signal discontinuities that undermine control stability and degrade performance.

To address this, this research proposes a **End-to-End Deep Reinforcement Learning (RL)** framework. By incorporating **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** units directly into the policy network, the agent effectively handles the partial observability caused by delays. It learns to reconstruct the system state internally and directly outputs **optimal torque commands**, balancing tracking accuracy with velocity smoothness without relying on separate state estimators or classical controllers.

## Repository Structure

The repository tracks the progressive development of the solution, containing the baselines and the final proposed framework.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as a ROS 2 workspace (`libfranka_ws`). Each major framework is contained within its own package, following a modular structure (Config, Nodes, Utils, and Core Algorithms).
