[33mCMake Warning (dev) at /usr/share/cmake-3.22/Modules/FindOpenGL.cmake:315 (message):
  Policy CMP0072 is not set: FindOpenGL prefers GLVND by default when
  available.  Run "cmake --help-policy CMP0072" for policy details.  Use the
  cmake_policy command to set the policy and suppress this warning.

  FindOpenGL found both a legacy GL library:

    OPENGL_gl_LIBRARY: /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libGL.so

  and GLVND libraries for OpenGL and GLX:

    OPENGL_opengl_LIBRARY: /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libOpenGL.so
    OPENGL_glx_LIBRARY: /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libGLX.so

  OpenGL_GL_PREFERENCE has not been set to "GLVND" or "LEGACY", so for
  compatibility with CMake 3.10 and below the legacy GL library will be used.

  By not providing "Findament_lint_auto.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this
  project has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "ament_lint_auto"

  Add the installation prefix of "ament_lint_auto" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or
  set "ament_lint_auto_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.
  If "ament_lint_auto" provides a separate development package or SDK, be
  sure it has been installed.
